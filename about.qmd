## Methods


The maps, charts, and quantitative summaries are based on data from [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/){target='none'} and the [Missouri Prescribed Fire Council (MPFC)](https://moprescribedfire.org/){target='none'}. The visuals are created as follows:

1. **Historical Ecosystems Map**: 
   - Clipped the [LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BpS)](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps){target='none'} to the Missouri state boundary.
   - Mapped and grouped historical ecosystems, renaming them to match MPFC terminology.

2. **Needed Mean Fire Return Interval Map**: 
   - Used LANDFIRE's [Existing Vegetation Type (EVT)](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/evt){target='none'} as a base.
   - MPFC members assigned each ecosystem a Missouri Department of Conservation Ecosystem name and an estimated historical fire regime in an Excel spreadsheet.
   - Joined the Excel data to the LANDFIRE EVT spatial data for mapping and summarization.

3. **Current Fire Needs by County Map**: 
   - Summarized data by county and ecosystem type.

4. **Historical Annual Burn Acreage by Ecosystem**: 
   - Created a chart summarizing minimum and maximum acreage burned by ecosystem type.

5. **Historical Mean Fire Return Interval (MFRI) Map**: 
   - Used the BpS attribute 'FRI_ALLFIR' to represent MFRI.
   - Grouped year values into categories shown in the map legend.
   - Applied the 'Magma' color ramp from [Viridis Palette Generator](https://waldyrious.net/viridis-palette-generator/){target='none'} for accessibility.

6. **Historical Burn Patterns Chart**: 
   - Summarized data by ecosystem type.

## Our Partnerships

Conservation success that is widespread and sustainable relies on partner and landowner interest and engagement as well as a long-term stewardship culture. No one person, or one organization can create the change needed on its own. Success requires the broad engagement of diverse stakeholder and policymakers. Here are just a few of those stakeholder organizations:
