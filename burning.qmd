It's true that wildfire can be devastating for lives and property,
particularly when it occurs in an unmanaged or overgrown forest.
However, prescribed fire can also be used to improve the health of your land
and mitigate the risks of wildfire. Fire can and should be used as
a management tool for much of Missouri's landscapes due to their
historical reliance on it. With a carefully considered burn plan,
prescribed fire becomes an efficient tool to manage farmland, manipulate
wildlife habitat and restore ecological communities (Robinson and
Doolen, 2023). 

Controlled burns are safe and an effective management tool when paired with the correct preparation. They usually are conducted with the help of burn plans, careful consideration of weather conditions and using trained crew members and professional
fire equipment (Missouri CCS, 2022). If you think that fire may be right
for your land read on!


## An Introduction to Controlled Burns for Landowners

Prescribed fire can be a safe and effective tool to manage your
property. By mimicking natural processes for fire-evolved landscapes,
landowners can reap a range of benefits, everything from fighting
invasive plants to boosting biodiversity and reducing risk of wildfires.
If you’re considering a burn, this guide will help you think through the
planning, preparation and execution to set you up for success.

### Before the Burn

1.  Call your local [Missouri Department of
    Conservation](https://mdc.mo.gov/contact-engage/local-mdc-contacts) (MDC)
    Private Lands Conservationist (PLC). PLCs can talk through your
    goals for property and help you develop an action plan for how to
    meet those goals. There are other options for private lands
    assistance including U.S. Fish and Wildlife, NRCS, and other
    Non-Governmental Organizations but a PLC is a great starting point
    and will be able to help you navigate the various programs in
    Missouri.

2.  Review state and local regulations, including liability under the
    [Missouri Prescribed Burning Act](Missouri Prescribed Burning Act_Guidance_Staff_FINAL.pdf).

3.  Create a detailed burn plan that covers all aspects of the
    operation, including how many people you will need, acceptable
    weather conditions and what to do in case of emergency. MDC,
    National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) or a private
    contractor can help. (More on contractors below.)

### Do It Yourself or Use a Contractor?

An experienced private contractor can handle the entire burn or take on
specific aspects, such as writing the plan or implementing a plan
written by MDC or NRCS. The Missouri Prescribed Fire Council has
compiled a [list of private
contractors](https://moprescribedfire.org/contractors). The [Missouri
Consulting Foresters
Association](https://missouriforesters.com/searchMCFA.php) also
maintains a list.

If you choose a contractor, ensure that you have a discussion about how
the liability for your prescribed fire will work. Some contractors
maintain their own, while others may utilize a different method.

If the contractor writes the burn plan, ensure that they provide you a
copy and answer any questions you have in advance.

If you are interested conducting the burn yourself, consider the
following steps:

1.  **Get trained.** Missouri has an online [ training
    program](https://www.hunter-ed.com/prescribedburn/sign-up/) that
    covers the basics of burning. You will also be required to attend an
    in-person fire field day (approximately 4-6 hours) after completing
    the online training. This field day occurs across the state at
    [various times of the
    year.](https://mdc-event-web.s3licensing.com/Event/AllEvents?maxDistance=50&EventTypeId=16&EventTitleId=16214&isVirtualIncluded=True)

2.  **Develop your burn plan.** A good burn plan is essential to your
    success and the safety of our neighbors and communities. MDC Private
    Lands Conservationists are a great resource and the place to start
    that process. PLCs are very busy and burn plans take time to
    develop. If you are hoping to have help from them to write a burn
    plan, please reach out to them several months ahead of your desired
    burn timeline. Again, a private contractor could also help with this
    step.

3.  **Get experience on other prescribed fires.** There is no
    substitution for hands-on experience when it comes to fire. One of
    the best ways to build your skills is to work alongside experienced
    burners by volunteering on other fires. The Missouri Prescribed Fire
    Council supports the development of [ Prescribed Burn
    Associations](https://moprescribedfire.org/pba-locations-contacts)
    (PBAs) across the state. PBAs are neighbors helping neighbors,
    ensuring landowners have enough help, resources and expertise to
    safely accomplish prescribed fires on their land. Helping a neighbor
    through your local PBA is also a great way to meet the people who
    can help you when conditions are right to burn your property.

4.  **Develop burn breaks around your intended burn unit.** A good burn
    break can mean the difference between success and failure. Your burn
    plan should address appropriate burn break design. A general rule is
    burn breaks should be 2x wider than anticipated fire height
    (Anticipated flame heights: Tallgrass = \~20 ft, Shortgrass = \~10
    ft., Leaf Litter = \~4 ft) If working in forest/woodland settings
    also pay attention to dead standing trees within 100 ft. of the burn
    break, they can throw sparks across your burn breaks easily.

### Day of the Burn

1.  **Review your burn plan and then follow it.** Deviating from your
    plan could invalidate it and leave you open to greater liability.
    This isn’t the time to wing it!

2.  **Pay attention to the [fire
    weather](https://www.weather.gov/dlh/fwd) forecast** for the day of
    your burn but, also for several afterwards. In Missouri, less than
    2% of prescribed fires escape the intended boundaries. Most of these
    relatively few escapes don’t occur during the burn operation but, in
    the days that follow when weather conditions change.

3.  **Check for [drought
    conditions](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?MO)
    or county wide burn bans.** Drought conditions may increase your
    fire behavior substantially.

4.  **Notify your local fire department and/or county dispatch** and
    neighbors to let them know of your plans to burn.

5.  **Gather your crew and equipment**. Many PBAs have equipment
    trailers they can loan you for your burn. Really think about what
    you need to pull off a burn, including anything you would need if the
    fire escapes its boundaries. It is also worth talking to your PLC to
    see if there is other equipment available for you to borrow.

6.  **Ask yourself the following:**

    -   Is the forecasted weather within the burn plan’s parameters and
        does it match what you are seeing on site?

    -   Have you reviewed your burn plan and thought through the
        sequence of events with the crew before the burn?

    -   Do you have as many people as your burn plan requires? Are they
        an experienced crew or new to fire?

    -   Do you have the required equipment and have you tested it to
        make sure it functions well?

    -   Do you have some way to get water out on the burn unit? Will you
        transport it by UTV, ATV, truck, trailer, and/or backpack water
        pump?

    -   Do you have a good way to communicate (i.e., good cell service
        or handheld two-way radios)? Have you tested your communication
        method before the fire?

7.  **Know your limits and accept when it’s just not your day to burn!**
    It is natural to be a little nervous before burning your property
    and/or participating in someone else’s fire operation. Preparation
    is everything, make sure you take the responsibilities laid out
    above seriously. The implementation of a burn is relatively short
    compared to the effort it takes to set yourself and your crew up for
    a successful burn.

### After the Burn

1.  Call back the fire department or county dispatch and let them know
    when your burn is complete.

2.  Follow your plan for monitoring burned areas and keep an eye on
    shifting weather conditions, such increasing winds or low relative
    humidities.

3.  [**Log your burn**](https://moprescribedfire.org/log-your-burn)**.**
    Help us track prescribed fire across the state by your fire
    accomplishments. The information lets us track how much good fire is
    hitting the ground and tells us if we are moving in the right
    direction across the state. It also helps us identify where and how
    we can help other landowners get the help they need to use fire on
    their property.
