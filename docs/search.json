    "text": "Fire has been a critical force in Missouri’s landscape for millennia– creating, shaping, and manipulating an environment that now depends on it. Fire is necessary for the health of many ecosystems that make Missouri unique. However, for the past 50+ years, our state has engaged in a very effective fire prevention and suppression program which has significantly altered the structure, diversity, and function of many of Missouri’s ecological communities (Missouri CCS, 2022).\n\nThroughout the United States, ecologists, land managers and owners have begun to recognize fire’s importance. Many states now use prescribed fire as a management tool that can effectively and affordably accomplish a variety of land management goals, like reducing fuel loads to reduce wildfire intensity, restoring native plant communities and improving animal habitats (Missouri CCS, 2022).\nMissouri was once dominated by fire adapted ecosystems which would have experienced a fire every 2 - 20 years (based on expert opinion and LANDFIRE data. See About page.). The map to the right shows Missouri’s past ecological layout, prior to European settlement. Each of the different ecosystems represented would have experienced fire at different frequencies, but almost all experienced regular fires,sometimes from natural disturbances, like lightning, but primarily from human intervention.\n\n\nIn 2023, conservationists and ecologists collaborated to estimate how often fire should visit today’s various ecosystems based on past frequencies as part of a statewide Fire Needs Assessment. The assessment helped us determine how much prescribed burning should be done in Missouri, and where. We found that burning a minimum of 2,635,008 acres per year is necessary to replicate the historical occurrences of fire that much of Missouri’s landscape is adapted to.\nThis report presents the findings of this assessment and displays the urgent need for increased prescribed fire in Missouri. The state is currently burning an estimated 125,000-150,000 acres per year, a dramatic shortfall that requires urgent and concerted efforts to close the gap. We hope that this report will show the benefits of fire and encourage readers to explore prescribed burning across Missouri for the benefit of nature and our working lands. This assessment is intended for use by private landowners and conservation professionals alike who are committed to the return of good fire practices across Missouri."

    "text": "Historic Burn Patterns\nIn the past, every ecosystem would have had its own Mean Fire Return Interval (MFRI), and extent. The chart below shows just how much variety in historical annual acres burned there was depending on ecosystem type as well as how extensively fire would affect them per year. Today, only an estimated 125,000-150,000 acres total are burned per year. In comparison, over 2 million acres of prairie systems alone would have burned prior to European settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Missouri’s policies and practices of wildfire suppression were implemented in the early 1900s, our plant communities and habitat have changed drastically. Forest canopies and midstories have closed, preventing light from reaching the forest floor. Woody vegetation has taken over what were once huge prairies. The photograph to the left is a great example of what shortleaf pine forests would have looked like prior to fire suppression. It was taken in the early 1900’s in the historic pineries of SE Missouri. Shortleaf pine was the dominant species in the region, allowing an incredibly diverse understory to flourish. Now, however, these forests are composed of different species that grow in ways that prevent sunlight from reaching the forest floor, suppressing native grasses and forbs. Fire has the potential to not only to reverse these changes, but strengthen remaining forests (Robinson & Doolen, 2023).\n\n\nKeep reading to find out more about Missouri’s current fire needs or, learn about the benefits of fire on Missouri’s ecosystems!"

    "text": "The health and quality of Missouri’s ecosystems depend on the responsible and consistent use of prescribed fire. The Missouri Fire Assessment finds that we need to be burning 2,635,008 acres statewide per year at the minimum in order to maintain existing landscapes in their current condition and improve ecosystem health and function. Our ecosystems have been harmed by years of past fire suppression, however, prescribed fire can be used to heal them by replicating historical trends.\nPrescribed fire has many benefits for landowners and conservationists, like preserving and improving wildlife habitats, increasing biodiversity and managing invasive species. Additionally, prescribed burns decrease fuel loads, minimizing the risk of wildfires in forests and woodlands, which also lessens the potential for devastating impacts to infrastructure and communities. Missouri, in particular, has numerous ecosystem types that are fire adapted, meaning they have evolved in the presence of frequent fires and now rely on them to remain healthy and vibrant (Missouri CSS, 2022)."

To do this, we first tallied the amount of land covered by each ecosystem per county, then multiplied by the minimum and maximum probability it would burn in any one year (land amounts from LANDFIRE’s Existing Vegetation Type data. See About page.). These estimates were totaled per county for the map below. The map depicts these very conservative estimates of the minimum and maximum values. You can click on each county to see the minimum and maximum acreage that should be burned in that county.\nExample calculation for a 1,000 acre ecosystem with a 5 year minimum Mean Fire Return Interval (MFRI):\n\n\\[\n5yr MFRI =1/5= AnnualProbability = 0.2\n\\]\n\\[\nAnnualAcresBurned = 1,000*0.2 = 200\n\\] \nThis map depicts the minimum and maximum acres of land that should be burned in order to replicate historical trends, and restore the landscapes that have spent millennia adapting to recurring fires.

    "text": "What’s at Stake\nMost of Missouri’s ecosystems have evolved to rely on fire, meaning that today, not only is prescribed fire beneficial, it is crucial for the continued functioning of Missouri’s ecosystems. Fire has always been a reliable sign of human presence, meaning the fires that shaped Missouri cannot occur without our assistance.\nThere are numerous benefits of prescribed fire for all residents of Missouri, human and animal alike. Prescribed fire can be used to:\n\nReduce tick populations which have flourished under the status quo of fire suppression (Gallagher, et.al., 2022).\nManage invasive plant species like fescue (Missouri CCS, 2022).\nIncrease the amount of carbon ecological communities are able to store (Missouri CCS, 2022).\n\n\n\nImprove and increase game animal habitat.\n\nLearn about how bobwhite quail rely on fire.\nFind out how fire compares to other deer habitat management techniques.\nLearn more about the relationship of turkey habitat and fire.\n\nImprove water and soil quality (Missouri CCS, 2022).\nProtect endangered ecosystems like Missouri’s tall grass prairies (Missouri CCS, 2022).\nStimulate oak and shortleaf pine regeneration (Robinson & Doolen, 2023; Missouri CCS, 2022).\nAnd more!\n\nIf we want to protect the environments that make Missouri unique and rebuild those that are declining, we need to work together to create a legacy of stewardship that endorses a long-term view of conservation as landowners, conservationists and policy makers."
