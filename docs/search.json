Fire has always been a reliable sign of human presence, meaning the fires that shaped Missouri cannot occur without our assistance.\nThere are numerous benefits of prescribed fire for all residents of Missouri, human and animal alike. Prescribed fire can be used to:\n\nReduce tick populations which have flourished under the status quo of fire suppression (Gallagher, et.al., 2022).\nManage invasive plant species like fescue (Missouri CCS, 2022).\nIncrease the amount of carbon ecological communities are able to store (Missouri CCS, 2022).\n\n\n\nImprove and increase game animal habitat.\n\nLearn about how bobwhite quail rely on fire.\nFind out how fire compares to other deer habitat management techniques.\nLearn more about the relationship of turkey habitat and fire.\n\nImprove water and soil quality (Missouri CCS, 2022).\nProtect endangered ecosystems like Missouri’s tall grass prairies (Missouri CCS, 2022).\nStimulate oak and shortleaf pine regeneration (Robinson & Doolen, 2023; Missouri CCS, 2022).\nAnd more!\n\nIf we want to protect the environments that make Missouri unique and rebuild those that are declining, we need to work together to create a legacy of stewardship that endorses a long-term view of conservation as landowners, conservationists and policy makers."

    "section": "An Introduction to Controlled Burns for Landowners",
    "text": "An Introduction to Controlled Burns for Landowners\nPrescribed fire can be a safe and effective tool to manage your property. By mimicking natural processes for fire-evolved landscapes, landowners can reap a range of benefits, everything from fighting invasive plants to boosting biodiversity and reducing risk of wildfires. If you’re considering a burn, this guide will help you think through the planning, preparation and execution to set you up for success.\n\nBefore the Burn\n\nCall your local Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) Private Lands Conservationist (PLC). PLCs can talk through your goals for property and help you develop an action plan for how to meet those goals. There are other options for private lands assistance including U.S. Fish and Wildlife, NRCS, and other Non-Governmental Organizations but a PLC is a great starting point and will be able to help you navigate the various programs in Missouri.\nReview state and local regulations, including liability under the Missouri Prescribed Burning Act.\nCreate a detailed burn plan that covers all aspects of the operation, including how many people you will need, acceptable weather conditions and what to do in case of emergency. MDC, National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) or a private contractor can help. (More on contractors below.)\n\n\n\nDo It Yourself or Use a Contractor?\nAn experienced private contractor can handle the entire burn or take on specific aspects, such as writing the plan or implementing a plan written by MDC or NRCS. The Missouri Prescribed Fire Council has compiled a list of private contractors. The Missouri Consulting Foresters Association also maintains a list.\nIf you choose a contractor, ensure that you have a discussion about how the liability for your prescribed fire will work. Some contractors maintain their own, while others may utilize a different method.\nIf the contractor writes the burn plan, ensure that they provide you a copy and answer any questions you have in advance.\nIf you are interested conducting the burn yourself, consider the following steps:\n\nGet trained. Missouri has an online training program that covers the basics of burning. You will also be required to attend an in-person fire field day (approximately 4-6 hours) after completing the online training. This field day occurs across the state at various times of the year.\nDevelop your burn plan. A good burn plan is essential to your success and the safety of our neighbors and communities. MDC Private Lands Conservationists are a great resource and the place to start that process. PLCs are very busy and burn plans take time to develop. If you are hoping to have help from them to write a burn plan, please reach out to them several months ahead of your desired burn timeline. Again, a private contractor could also help with this step.\nGet experience on other prescribed fires. There is no substitution for hands-on experience when it comes to fire. One of the best ways to build your skills is to work alongside experienced burners by volunteering on other fires. The Missouri Prescribed Fire Council supports the development of Prescribed Burn Associations (PBAs) across the state. PBAs are neighbors helping neighbors, ensuring landowners have enough help, resources and expertise to safely accomplish prescribed fires on their land. Helping a neighbor through your local PBA is also a great way to meet the people who can help you when conditions are right to burn your property.\nDevelop burn breaks around your intended burn unit. A good burn break can mean the difference between success and failure. Your burn plan should address appropriate burn break design. A general rule is burn breaks should be 2x wider than anticipated fire height (Anticipated flame heights: Tallgrass = ~20 ft, Shortgrass = ~10 ft., Leaf Litter = ~4 ft) If working in forest/woodland settings also pay attention to dead standing trees within 100 ft. of the burn break, they can throw sparks across your burn breaks easily.\n\n\n\nDay of the Burn\n\nReview your burn plan and then follow it. Deviating from your plan could invalidate it and leave you open to greater liability. This isn’t the time to wing it!\nPay attention to the fire weather forecast for the day of your burn but, also for several afterwards. In Missouri, less than 2% of prescribed fires escape the intended boundaries. Most of these relatively few escapes don’t occur during the burn operation but, in the days that follow when weather conditions change.\nCheck for drought conditions or county wide burn bans. Drought conditions may increase your fire behavior substantially.\nNotify your local fire department and/or county dispatch and neighbors to let them know of your plans to burn.\nGather your crew and equipment. Many PBAs have equipment trailers they can loan you for your burn. Really think about what you need to pull off a burn, including anything you would need if the fire escapes its boundaries. It is also worth talking to your PLC to see if there is other equipment available for you to borrow.\nAsk yourself the following:\n\nIs the forecasted weather within the burn plan’s parameters and does it match what you are seeing on site?\nHave you reviewed your burn plan and thought through the sequence of events with the crew before the burn?\nDo you have as many people as your burn plan requires? Are they an experienced crew or new to fire?\nDo you have the required equipment and have you tested it to make sure it functions well?\nDo you have some way to get water out on the burn unit? Will you transport it by UTV, ATV, truck, trailer, and/or backpack water pump?\nDo you have a good way to communicate (i.e., good cell service or handheld two-way radios)? Have you tested your communication method before the fire?\n\nKnow your limits and accept when it’s just not your day to burn! It is natural to be a little nervous before burning your property and/or participating in someone else’s fire operation. Preparation is everything, make sure you take the responsibilities laid out above seriously. The implementation of a burn is relatively short compared to the effort it takes to set yourself and your crew up for a successful burn.\n\n\n\nAfter the Burn\n\nCall back the fire department or county dispatch and let them know when your burn is complete.\nFollow your plan for monitoring burned areas and keep an eye on shifting weather conditions, such increasing winds or low relative humidities.\nLog your burn. Help us track prescribed fire across the state by your fire accomplishments. The information lets us track how much good fire is hitting the ground and tells us if we are moving in the right direction across the state. It also helps us identify where and how we can help other landowners get the help they need to use fire on their property."

The Missouri Fire Assessment finds that we need to be burning 2,635,008 acres statewide per year at the minimum in order to maintain existing landscapes in their current condition and improve ecosystem health and function. Our ecosystems have been harmed by years of past fire suppression, however, prescribed fire can be used to heal them by replicating historical trends.\nPrescribed fire has many benefits for landowners and conservationists, like preserving and improving wildlife habitats, increasing biodiversity and managing invasive species. Additionally, prescribed burns decrease fuel loads, minimizing the risk of wildfires in forests and woodlands, which also lessens the potential for devastating impacts to infrastructure and communities. Missouri, in particular, has numerous ecosystem types that are fire adapted, meaning they have evolved in the presence of frequent fires and now rely on them to remain healthy and vibrant (Missouri CSS, 2022)."

    "text": "Historic Burn Patterns\nIn the past, every ecosystem would have had its own Mean Fire Return Interval (MFRI), and extent. The chart below shows just how much variety in historical annual acres burned there was depending on ecosystem type as well as how extensively fire would affect them per year. Today, only an estimated 125,000-150,000 acres total are burned per year. In comparison, over 2 million acres of prairie systems alone would have burned prior to European settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Missouri’s policies and practices of wildfire suppression were implemented in the early 1900s, our plant communities and habitat have changed drastically. Forest canopies and midstories have closed, preventing light from reaching the forest floor. Woody vegetation has taken over what were once huge prairies. The photograph to the left is a great example of what shortleaf pine forests would have looked like prior to fire suppression. It was taken in the early 1900’s in the historic pineries of SE Missouri. Shortleaf pine was the dominant species in the region, allowing an incredibly diverse understory to flourish. Now, however, these forests are composed of different species that grow in ways that prevent sunlight from reaching the forest floor, suppressing native grasses and forbs. Fire has the potential to not only to reverse these changes, but strengthen remaining forests (Robinson & Doolen, 2023).\n\n\nKeep reading to find out more about Missouri’s current fire needs or, learn about the benefits of fire on Missouri’s ecosystems!"
