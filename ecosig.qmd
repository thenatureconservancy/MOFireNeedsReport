“Many…plant species and significant numbers of animal species…greatly benefit from prescribed fire.
Without it, many imperiled species and communities of conservation concern would decline and diminish.” (Missouri CCS, 2022, p.153).

## What's at Stake

Most of Missouri’s ecosystems have evolved to rely on fire, meaning that today, not only is prescribed fire beneficial, it is crucial for the continued functioning of Missouri's ecosystems.
Fire has always been a reliable sign of human presence, meaning the fires that shaped Missouri cannot occur without our assistance.

There are numerous benefits of prescribed fire for all residents of Missouri, human and animal alike.
Prescribed fire can be used to:

-   Reduce tick populations which have flourished under the status quo of fire suppression (Gallagher, et.al., 2022).

-   Manage invasive plant species like fescue (Missouri CCS, 2022).

-   Increase the amount of carbon ecological communities are able to store (Missouri CCS, 2022).

-   Improve and increase game animal habitat.

-   Improve water and soil quality (Missouri CCS, 2022).

-   Protect endangered ecosystems like Missouri's tall grass prairies (Missouri CCS, 2022).

-   Stimulate oak and shortleaf pine regeneration (Robinson & Doolen, 2023; Missouri CCS, 2022).

-   And more!

If we want to protect the environments that make Missouri unique and rebuild those that are declining, we need to work together to create a legacy of stewardship that endorses a long-term view of conservation as landowners, conservationists and policy makers.
